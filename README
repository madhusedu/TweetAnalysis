Packages Used:
==============
- csv
- gensim
- subprocess
- nltk
- re

How to run the code:
====================

1. Preprocessing (preprocess.py)

This script performs preprocessing of the tweet from the tweet file input.

- input file: You have to modify the input file in preprocess.py
- output file: You have to modify the output file path in preprocess.py

****************************************************************************************************************
MUST: Please do not rename the output file. We have to keep it 0.txt for the Biterm topic model code
written by author to run without a segmentation fault.
****************************************************************************************************************

Steps:

1. Open preprocess.py in an editor
2. Modify the inputFile and output file path
3. Make sure you have all the required packages
4. Then execute using "python preprocess.py"

2. Topic Modeling (topicmodel.py)

This script performs topic modeling using two methods namely LDA and Biterm topic modeling.

- input file: You have to modify the input file path in topicmodel.py. The input file is the output of preprocess.py.
- output files:

Steps:

1. Open topicmodel.py in an editor


3. Main (main.py)

Calls the preprocessor and then performs topic modeling.

 - input
 - output

 Steps:

 1. Open main.py in an editor



Explanation of Algorithms:
==========================

1. Preprocessing:

This script is used to clean the tweet text. It removes any URLs, Trailing hash tags (does this by tokenizing a sentence
and hence deleting hash from the end until you hit a non-hashtagged string), @ symbol for names and also HTML tags (used BeautifulSoup
package to remove HTML tags).

Basically, it opens the CSV file, reads only the tweet_id and the text and ignores rest of the columns from the dataset.
Performs preprocessing as mentioned above and then write the {tweet_id, text} pair to an output file.

2. Topic Modeling:
